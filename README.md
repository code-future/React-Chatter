# React Chatter

## Introduction
In this project, you'll be building out the main features of a realtime chat app.

## Concepts
Make sure you have a basic understanding of these topics!
[] React
[] ES6
[] Firebase
[] Network requests
[] Node/NPM

## Steps:
0. Setup

   a. First, make sure you clone the repo on your computer. 
   
   `git clone https://github.com/code-future/React-Chatter.git`
   
   b. Once you're in the root folder of the project, you need to install the libraries that our app uses. Use `yarn` if you      have it. Otherwise, run `npm install`.
   
   c. Open the folder in your favorite text editor.
   
   d. Start the app with `npm start`. In Chrome/Firefox, go to `localhost:8080`. Hot reload is enabled, which means when you make a change to the file the app will automatically rebuild and your browser will refresh `localhost:8080`!!
   
   e. Up and running ðŸš€
   
1. Structure
  
   a. First, take some time to see if you can understand what the app is doing so far. Interact with the app, and take some      time to read through the source code. 
   
   b. Folder/file descriptions. * indicates that these files are incomplete, so they need your help!
   ```
   react-chatter
   â”‚   .babelrc <-- Our configuration for [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
   |   .gitignore <-- Where we list the files/folders we want git to ignore
   |   * App.jsx <-- The root React file for our app. Start here!
   |   index.html <-- The root HTML file for our webpage.
   |   package.json <-- NPM's configuration file. Here you'll find start scripts and our list of libraries.
   â”‚   README.md <-- Hey that's me!
   |   webpack.config.js <-- Webpack's configuration file. Tells Webpack what/where to compile
   â”‚
   â””â”€â”€â”€components <-- Our React Components go in here
   â”‚   â”‚   * ChatInput.jsx <-- The input box for the chat 
   â”‚   â”‚   * ChatList.jsx <-- The place where the chats show up
   |   |   UserModal.jsx <-- The popup modal that asks for the user's name
   â”‚   â”‚
   â””â”€â”€â”€node_modules <-- This huge folder is where Node/NPM installs our libraries (modules). Not really worth looking at
   |   |
   |   |
   â””â”€â”€â”€stylesheets <-- Our style files (SASS, CSS) go here
   â”‚   â”‚   main.scss <-- The main style file for our app.

2. Getting chats
  
   a. First order of business: this is a chat app, so we need to be able to see the chats. We're using 
   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as our way of storing chats. Your task is to connect to our Firebase using the `firebase` node module.
   
   b. We've initialized Firebase for you in `App.jsx`. We also connect to our messages database and set the messages to the state in componentDidMount. 
   
   - [ ] Start by passing `this.state.chats` as (props)[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html] to `ChatList`.
   
   - [ ] Go into `ChatList.jsx` and make sure you passed in the right value by `console.log`ging the list (that you passed into props) in the `render()` of ChatList. Make sure to have your browser console open to see the log! Really study the structure of the data
   
   - [ ] Under the `console.log` statement, create a variable that is equal to a transformed list of chats. Use the built-in `map` method to transform the list of objects into a list of JSX elements. See (this)[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html] for more help
   
   - [ ] Substitute the `<Feed.Event>` tags that we have prewritten for you with your variable that equals the transformed list. Make sure to put `{ }` around it so that the JSX can recognize it as JavaScript!
   
   - [ ] When the chats start showing up, you've passed this step!
   
3. Sending chats
   
   a. Now we need to allow the user to send chats. Go to `ChatInput.jsx` and read through the source code. 
   
   - [ ] Create an object called `message` that has 3 keys:
      - `text`: the text of the message (in this case the value of the chat input)
      - `time`: set it to `Date.now()`
      - `username`: the username of the sender
    
   - [ ] Pass in `this.state.chatInput` and `this.state.username` as props and set the values of the `message` object appropriately
   
   - [ ] On the next line, add this snippet that connects to firebase and adds our message to the database:
   ```
   const newMsgRef = firebase.database()
                              .ref('messages')
                              .push();
    message.id = newMsgRef.key;
    newMsgRef.set(message);
    ```
    
    - [ ] Test out your chat! Bonus: if you want to clear out your chat input after you send a message, create a function in `App.jsx` that clears `this.state.chatInput` and then pass that function into `ChatInput` as props.
    
    
Bonus:

- Add animations
